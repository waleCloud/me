I recently wrote about how [ProteusAI is moving from building a tool to an Operator](https://medium.com/@walecloud/2025-refection-we-stopped-building-a-tool-and-started-building-an-operator-26a55f3da9ac) and OnBuddy being the Autonomous Worker Operator that the world truly needed to get past the frenzy of merely AI assisted softwares and tools and closer towards the pursuit of general intelligence and Large Language Agency.

We believe It's not enough that AI knows the goal of a task or finished outcome of an existing system, it needs to know the reasoning behind the choices that was made to get to that point, how those choices came about.

There has to be a stronger "context link" to get to true AI Agency

A Classic Work

The average modern employee revolves around ~7 tools at least with each having some form of AI-assistance in there.

its no longer a case of too many tools no actual usecase but a case of too many AI-assistance with less context-link

Data Fragmentation amongst tools is a problem today and no you can't solve it by more MCP or context sharing a. [add a parable]

Ontology, time series event captured realtime, not the final state
