#### - Yutars

Talking about work and career, 2021 was both High and Low for my colleagues and I at <https://yutars.com>. We had over 7 Lenders using our platform at a time and running their FGN Negative investigation through us,
That triggered the birth of Blacklist to help with fraud prevention and reporting as we couldn’t get direct integration to these Lending companies due to according to them, “Licence”.

What is Yutars?

A shared infrastructure bridging the real-time information asymmetry gap in Africa financial services one country at a time.

### What didn't go well

We tried getting funding but we were handed a handful of Nos. Did we stop? No. We continued and hired an Operator to further serve the lenders using our platform, this continued till the end of Q3 where the adoption dropped as the market demand changed to what we’ve been building but lacked the necessary toolkit (funding & licence).

We realised we could not meet payroll going forward and infrastructure bills kept pilling up so we did the honourable thing and let go of team members.

Sad to say we’re at a phase where we’re not sure how to proceed but as with everything since 2019, time makes things clearer.
