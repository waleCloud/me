Friday 3pm EST 20th of August 2021 was the last moment I stopped being a <a href=https://namely.com target=_blank>Namely</a> employee after 1.8 years at the company.

> While living, we have the chance to live several lives as long as we're willing to.  - Paraphrasing off the netflix series `Money Heist`, a statement made by the character Tokyo.

## Birthing a new timeline into wale-cinematic universe.

People act surprised when they learnt I resigned from my role without having another offer from somewhere else to replace it with. I understand their sentiments because it isn't the norm to be jobless voluntarily except for cases of employer mistreatment etc.

This however was a necessary step for me as I believe working shouldn't be far-fetched from living, People treat work separately from their lifes, dedicating time to **Live** after working.

- Why can't it be both?
- Does it have to be different?
- Are we meant to work and live separately?
- Who even decides these things for us?

##### The question now is what will I be upto Next?

> I am taking a Sabbatical for a Year. <br />
> Not taking any new roles at the moment till the end of the 2022, however, I will be open to consulting opportunities from next year.

To make this post short, I will write about how we built the `Report Builder` and made ground works for the now `Intelligence` App at <a href=https://namely.com target=_blank>Namely</a>.
