I have been sitting on this thought about Artificail Intelligence and how we've and still adapting to this big step in the journey of creating a near human level form of intelligence, i argue that we've definitely created a knowledge bank greater than one any human would be capabale of.

With this thought and other thoughts of mine sitting and waiting to be let out from captivity, like  a kid anticipating the sound of a school bell.

I intend to spread this into a mini short series i'm calling Artificial what ifs...

Inspiration for the title is coming from marvels what if series, which i love by the way (like it wasn't obvious). The twist here won't be a misplacement of characters but of questioning what exactly is going on, with the rave of AI and what is intelligence and is it truly intelligent? Are my going to be out of a job soon? (Not if your job requires some form of creativity or human needs).

Lets dive right in with the obvious again (pun intended), What if AI isn't really intelligent? I mean it can probable do a better writing than this :eyes: scratch that, it can't! it can for sure come up with a faster version but it will at best mimick my writing and miss out on the heart!

Back to the real gist, what is AI is just really good at mimicking intelligence? These systems digest vast amount of human-created content and regurgitate it back to us in ways that seems fresh and insightful. Are they actually understanding anything or are they high volume capacity pattern-matching machines, creating the illusion of comprehension.
