I have been sitting on this though about Artificail Intelligence and how we've and still adapting to this big step in the journey of creating a near human level of intelligence, i argue that we've definitely created a knowledge bank greater than whan any human would be capabale of.

With this thought and other thoughts of mine sitting and waiting to be let out from captivity like  a kid anticipating the sound of a school bell.

I intend to spread this into a mini short series i'm calling Artificial what ifs...

Inspiration for the title is coming from marvels what if series, which i love by the way (like it wasn't obvious). The twist here won't be a misplacement of characters but of questioning what exactly is going on, with the rave of AI and what is intelligence and is it truly intelligent? Are my going to be out of a job soon? (if your job requires some form of creativity or human needs, AI  )
