Almost everything in the world has an input and a form of output, each input  & output differs and has constraint to an agreeable extent within the system their operating in which is usually part of another  system as either an input or composed output in a given form. That's a deduction i've made overtime from watching and experiencing the world with my lense.

Knowledge comes in various forms and through various channels. Organizations have documented knowledge that needs to be created by someone intentionally. this knowledge often grows as the organization begins to grow either in headcount or product expansion and scale.

The Knowledge store grows and become cumbersome to fine meaningful insights, with the advent of AI and RAG systems, this can now be solved, leaving the lack of insight driver to not asking the right questions.

There's a dilemma with companies losing senior and highly competent junior & mid-level talent and these talent often leave with the Expert knowledge about the organization that couldn't be captured by basic documentation. knowledge & data over spoken conversations, debates with another colleague over implementation details which always involves indept knowledge and system familiarity.

These coversations are now happenng with chat agents in our workspaces and these knowledge are even going to be harder to be captured and the organizations continue to miss out on key insights.

The OnBuddy team just demoed a brilliant feature that helps capture tacit knowledge that would otherwise be lost because it wasn't explicitly captured on a word document or sent via email.

This is truly a game changer in improving workspace efficiency and boosting productivity.

Welcome to the future of retaining expert knowledge without any extra effort.

just like that, you're 10x better in retaining & transfering your companies SMEs (Subject Matter Expert) knowledge across to relevant people.
